# ui5-testcafe-selector-utils
Using this package you are able to realize end to end testing with UI5 and [testcafe](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe).
Generally this package allows you to define selectors, perform actions and assertions on any element based on UI5. Supported are general UI5 / FIORI applications, SAP Lumira and SAP Analytics Cloud.

For documentation please have a look at the following SAP Blog-Posts which are kept up to date.

1. [Overview and first test](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/12/27/automated-testing-with-ui5/)
2. [Enhanced Selection, Action and Assertion Possibilities](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/12/28/automated-testing-with-ui5-part-2/)
3. [Structure your test and common best-practices](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/12/29/automated-testing-with-ui5-part-3/)
4. [Code-Coverage for Integration and E2E tests](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/12/30/automated-testing-with-ui5-part-4/)
5. [Integration in CI (Jenkins / Github Actions) / Authentification](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/01/01/automated-testing-with-ui5-part-5/)

This documentation will therefore be a pure technical reference of all possible selectors, actions and assertions provided by this library.

This documentation therefore provides the following sections:
| Section        | Content      |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| [Selectors](./doc/selectors.md)      | All possibilities to create selectors for UI5 | 
| [Configuration (WIP)](./doc/config.md) | Configuration of testcafe|
| [Tracing and Debugging (WIP)](./doc/debug.md)      | How to debug in case your selection goes wrong      |
